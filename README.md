This repository contains the pyphenocam package for accessing, processing and visulaizing
data from the phenocam network (https://phenocam.sr.unh.edu/webcam/)

This directory also contains example notebooks which outline the experimental work done by the 
North Central Science Center to analyse these data and integrate them into a larger scientific framework.

While the code contained in this repository has developed and used by researchers it has not been 
finalized or tested extensively.  Please consider it a pre-alpha package that could be quite useful to 
researchers with a background in Python but one that is ready for widespread usage by novice programmers. 
Contact the developers if you have any questions about usage or development.
